# Apple Human Interface Guidelines (SwiftUI)

## Primary sections to consult
- Typography: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography
- Layout: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout
- Color: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color
- Navigation: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/navigation

## Quick reminders
- Prefer system font with Dynamic Type; avoid fixed sizes unless absolutely necessary.
- Respect safe areas and platform spacing; avoid edge-to-edge text blocks.
- Use color for meaning, not decoration; maintain contrast in both Light and Dark Mode.
- Keep navigation predictable with native patterns (TabView, NavigationStack, NavigationSplitView).
